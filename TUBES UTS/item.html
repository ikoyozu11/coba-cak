      <p>Pokemon Items</p>
      <p>An item (Japanese: 道具 tool) is an object in the Pokémon games which the player can pick up, keep in their Bag, and use in some manner. They have various uses, including healing, powering up, helping one to catch Pokémon, or accessing new areas.</p>

      <p>How To Obtain Items</p>
      <p>Items are obtained in several different ways. They can be given to the player by characters within the game, be bought at a Poké Mart for money, or found by the player throughout the Pokémon world. The latter form of items are officially referred to as item balls (Japanese: アイテムボール item ball), spherical containers resembling a Poké Ball. To obtain the item, players move next to it and press A while facing it. In Pokémon Colosseum and Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, many items are found in treasure chests modeled after Poké Balls; in addition, items are often found in bulk from these chests, rather than only singular. Another method introduced in Generation II is picking Berries off a Berry tree. Join Avenue was introduced in Pokémon Black and White 2, allowing players to buy certain items in bulk, as well as Berries and some rare items. Pokémon encountered in the wild will sometimes be holding items, which can be obtained by catching them using a Poké Ball or by using either Trick, Thief, Switcheroo, or Covet. Also, in certain areas in Generation VI, various scenery will appear in the background during some battles. Using specific moves, depending on the kind of scenery, will break the scenery and cause an item to be found at the end of the battle, with the message player found a item in the aftermath."
        Most items can be obtained at any time, but there are a small number of permanently missable items in some games that become unobtainable after the player has progressed beyond a certain point. </p>
